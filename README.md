# TestnetBinaries
Equibit Testnet Binaries Distribution

## Welcome to the Equibit Testnet
This repository contains executables for the Equibit network. For more information about Equibit, please visit www.equibitgroup.com.

## Downloadable Binaries
The binaries included in this repository are NOT production ready. Equibit Group is distributing this software to a selected group of miners and blockchain operators who have signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to provide hashing power for the future Equibit Mainnet.

Our software toolchain currently only compiles binaries for Ubuntu (16.04). We intend on also creating 64-bit Windows binaries very shortly. Likewise, we will be adding binaries for a modified version of bfgminer that supports the Equibit block structure and protocol.  

## Expectations Management
Volunteers are welcome to download and install these binaries, provided they agree with the terms and conditions below. In short: this is an unfinished work. We are inviting a limited set of volunteers to join the Testnet to *debug* the application. This application will crash. This application will segfault. This application will lose connectivity. This application is under development.

Once the Testnet period is over, a production-ready Mainnet application will be launched to the general public. Please stay tuned to our Telegram channel for additional details about our roadmap and launch schedule: https://t.me/Equibit

## How to run the Binaries
The binaries were compiled to run on Ubuntu 16.04. 64-bit Windows binaries will also be provided shortly. Equibit is a modified fork of the Bitcoin repository. Most Bitcoin dependencies and APIs are shared with Equibit. Additional details to follow.

### Dependencies
{to be documented}

## Roles and Responsibilities
The goal is to launch a successful Equibit network. We welcome all contributions and expertise that will help make that goal a reality. Everyone who has been given access to this repository has unique experience with peer-to-peer network. Let's all be respectful of each other and operate under the basis of peers working with peers.  

The Equibit network needs our expertise in running nodes, but also in setting up a good community management process, documentation, community leadership, and more. Please make sure to join the Equibit Testnet A-Team channel on Telegram by contacting christian@equibitgroup.com.
